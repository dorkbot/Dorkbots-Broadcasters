Dorkbots-Broadcasters
=================

Dorkbots Broadcasters is a flexible framework for adding and remove listeners to any object and passing objects in the event handler's parameter. Includes a strict state update and declaration system for use in an observer pattern. Lighter than Flash’s Events and doesn’t bubble. It’s not a replacement for Flash’s event system, but a lighter option for use outside of the Display List.
